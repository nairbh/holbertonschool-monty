# Monty Interpreter

Monty Interpreter is a program that interprets Monty bytecode files. Monty is a minimalistic programming language with a specific set of instructions.

## Compilation & Output

To compile the Monty Interpreter, run the following command:

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o monty
```

Any output generated by the program must be printed on stdout, while any error messages must be printed on stderr.

## Monty Language

Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty bytecodes (similar to Python). It uses a unique stack and provides specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty bytecode files.

## Monty Bytecode Files

Monty bytecode files have the extension `.m`. Each line in the file represents an instruction. Instructions can have an optional argument. Here are some characteristics of Monty bytecode files:

- Instructions are separated by new lines.
- There can be any number of spaces before or after an opcode and its argument.
- Blank lines are allowed and can contain spaces.
- Any text following an opcode or its required argument is not considered.

Example Monty bytecode file (`byte.m`):

```
push 1
push 2
push 3
pall
```

```
./monty byte.m
```
output

```
3
2
1
```
## The Monty Program

The Monty program is executed with the following command:

```
./monty file.m
```

- `file` is the path to the file containing Monty bytecode.

The program follows these rules:

- If no file is provided or more than one argument is given, print the error message "USAGE: monty file" on stderr, followed by a new line, and exit with status `EXIT_FAILURE`.
- If it's not possible to open the file, print the error message "Error: Can't open file <file>" on stderr, followed by a new line, and exit with status `EXIT_FAILURE`.
```
```
## Supported Instructions

The Monty Interpreter supports the following instructions:

- `push`: Pushes an integer onto the stack.
- `pall`: Prints all values on the stack.
- `pint`: Prints the value at the top of the stack.
- `pop`: Removes the top element of the stack.
- `swap`: Swaps the top two elements of the stack.
- `add`: Adds the top two elements of the stack.
- `nop`: Does nothing.

## Exit Status

The Monty Interpreter returns the following exit statuses:

- `EXIT_SUCCESS` (0): Successful execution.
- `EXIT_FAILURE` (1): Error occurred during execution.

## File Structure

The Monty code is organized into the following files:

- `monty.h`: Header file containing function prototypes and data structures.
- `main.c`: Main entry point of the program, handles file reading and execution.
- `execute.c`: Contains the function to execute Monty bytecode instructions.
- `opcode.c`: Contains functions to manipulate the stack (push, pop, swap, etc.).

## Tests

It is highly recommended to write a comprehensive set of tests to ensure the correctness of the Monty Interpreter. Collaborate with your team to create a test suite that covers all instructions and edge cases.
